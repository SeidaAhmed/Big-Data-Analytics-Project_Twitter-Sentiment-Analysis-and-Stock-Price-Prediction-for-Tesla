# Big-Data-Analytics-Project_Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Stock-Price-Prediction-for-Tesla
Analyze  impact of sentiment made in Twitter for Tesla's stock price using NLP 

Introduction: 
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets and investigate how it affects Tesla’s stock prices in recent years. The project involves collecting tweets, analyzing their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral), and studying the connection between sentiment and stock price movements. The project focuses on sentiment analysis and predictive modeling. As it is stated in various sources social media sentiment analysis allows brands to monitor real-time online conversations about themselves and their competitors, gaining measurable insights into how positively or negatively they are perceived
Datasets:
For this project, I use Twitter’s API to collect tweets related to Tesla. Additionally, I gather historical stock price data of Tesla from Yahoo Finance: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history/. If tweets alone are not enough source of information to do the analysis, I may add financial News headline data regarding the company from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/gudlaarunkumar/financial-news-headline-sentiment
Tools and Techniques:
1.	Data Collection: Gather Twitter data using the Twitter API by searching for tweets mentioning Tesla and relevant keywords in recent years. Collect historical stock price data for Tesla from financial websites or APIs like Yahoo Finance.
2.	Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I will do basic data cleaning and EDA before doing the actual analysis: These includes handling missing values and outliers, data visualization to see basic pattern and get preliminary understanding of the data. To do this I will use python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib in Jupiter notebook
3.	Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of collected tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). Classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content and sentiment scores.
4.	Feature Engineering: Extract additional features from the Twitter data, such as tweet volume, retweet count, and user engagement metrics. These features provide insights into the intensity and spread of sentiment across social media platforms.
5.	Stock Price Prediction: Develop a predictive model to forecast Tesla stock price/market share using sentiment analysis results and historical stock price data. Utilize machine learning algorithms like linear regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and deep learning techniques such as LSTM for time series prediction. Incorporate sentiment scores, tweet volume, and other relevant features into the predictive model.
6.	Evaluation and Interpretation: Assess the performance of the predictive model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score. Interpret the model's predictions and analyze the impact of sentiment on Starbucks' stock price/market share during the boycott period.
7.	Create Dashboard: If time permit, I will create a dashboard using Big Query which visualizes the impact of tweets on stock price in real-time
